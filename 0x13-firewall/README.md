Introduction
Firewalls play a crucial role in network security by controlling and monitoring network traffic based on predetermined rules. This project aims to implement a firewall solution to protect a network infrastructure from unauthorized access and potential threats.

Features
Blocking unauthorized incoming traffic
Allowing specific ports and protocols
Configurable firewall rules
Integration with existing network infrastructure
Logging and monitoring of network traffic
Requirements
Linux-based operating system (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian)
Root privileges or administrative access
Compatible firewall software (e.g., ufw, iptables)
Basic understanding of networking and firewall concepts
Installation
Clone the repository:
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/firewall-project.git
Install the required firewall software (e.g., ufw):
Copy
sudo apt-get install ufw
[Optional] Set up any additional dependencies or software required for your specific firewall implementation.
Configuration
Define the firewall rules based on your network requirements and security policies.
Modify the configuration files or use command-line tools provided by the firewall software to set up the desired rules.
Enable and start the firewall to activate the configured rules.
Test the firewall to ensure that the expected traffic is allowed and unauthorized access is blocked.
Usage
Start the firewall:
Copy
sudo ufw enable
Check the status of the firewall:
Copy
sudo ufw status
Monitor the firewall logs for any suspicious activity:
Copy
sudo tail -f /var/log/ufw.log
Update the firewall rules as needed to accommodate changes in network requirements or security policies.
